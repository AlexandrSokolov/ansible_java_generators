#### File based project configuration 

It is a combination of a property file (configuration file) and `Configuration` interface.

In the `Configuration` interface we add methods, annotated based on property names.

For different return types different separator must be used in the propery file.

[See: `Configuration` interface usage](configuration.interface.md)
